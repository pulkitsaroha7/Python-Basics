# Function caching is a technique for improving the performance of a program by storing the results of a function call so that you can reuse the results instead of recomputing them every time the function is called. This can be particularly useful when a function is computationally expensive, or when the inputs to the function are unlikely to change frequently. In Python, function caching can be achieved using the functools.lru_cache decorator. The functools.lru_cache decorator is used to cache the results of a function so that you can reuse the results instead of recomputing them every time the function is called.
# import functools --> we can use this or this:
from functools import lru_cache
import time
# @functools.lru_cache(maxsize = None) --> if we use first method then use this else:
@lru_cache(maxsize=None) 
def fx(n):
  time.sleep(3)
  return n*5
    
print(fx(20))
print("done for 20")
print(fx(2))
print("done for 2")
print(fx(6))
print("done for 6")

print(fx(20))
print("done for 20")
print(fx(2))
print("done for 2")
print(fx(6))
print("done for 6")
print(fx(61))
print("done for 61")
